# Perr - The server part of Your app for selling goods 📦

## What does it give?
Ready-made functionality for processing orders via the REST API. You only need to write a payment processing module. Well, the client part will also need to be written *(ノ^o^)ノ*

## How does it work?  
You just need to download this repository and set the configuration files according to the documentation. Basic functionality will work without problems. Obviously, for your service you will need to add additional functionality, follow the recommendations of the documentation on this matter so that everything works correctly!

The application was written in Go, the application was inspired by the ideas of 🧼 clean architecture 🫧 , so it's pretty simple and understandable to add and improve the code for your service!
